# Banking System Repository

Welcome to the Banking System repository! This repository contains the source code for a simple banking system written in Java 17. Users can manage their accounts, view balances, make deposits, and withdrawals.

## Features

- **Account Creation**: Users can create both checking and savings accounts within the application.
- **Account Verification**: Users can check if they already have an account. If not, they will be redirected to create a new account.
- **View Balance**: Users can view the balance of their checking and savings accounts.
- **Make Deposits**: Users can deposit funds into their checking or savings accounts.
- **Make Withdrawals**: Users can withdraw funds from their checking or savings accounts.

## How to Use

   ```
git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
cd banking-system
   ```

3. Compile and run the application using your preferred Java development environment (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or command line:
